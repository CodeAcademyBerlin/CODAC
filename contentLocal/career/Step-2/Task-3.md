**Coverletter**
In addition to your resume, still lots of companies will ask you to write a cover letter. 
This can be painful but also a good way to present yourself and talk more about details that you want the reader to know about you. A well designed, taylored and interesting to read cover letter can be a nice opportunity to impress recruiters. 
Online you will find a variety of examples to use, innovative & creative approaches as well as a lot of crap. One of those we can recommend, you can find [here](https://resumegenius.com/cover-letter-examples).
As for the CV, there is not a golden rule to follow, again you should feel comfortable with it and make sure to follow some advice and minimum standards that we will cover here.

A great cover letter should contain five sections:

 1. **Header**
 2. **Intro**
 3. **Main body**
 4. **Soft skills**
 5. **Closing**

 For the *header*, it should include your contact information, the position you are applying for as well as the contact information of the employer. If they do not mention a person to contact, we strongly suggest putting in some effort to find it out. It's okay to call or write them over LinkedIn, in the end you will have an advantage over other candidates.

The tricky part is the *introduction*, you want to attract the recruiter to keep reading, give the key information and make the link to the position. Try to combine these three major aspects in two or three sentences and finish strong with a first argument why you are a perfect fit to the job. We can not give you the words to use, because we want it to sound like you and it should come authentic. 
Also mention where or how you got to know about this position. Doing the recruiter a little favor here always helps.

In the *main body*, you talk about your previous experience, degrees, relevant facts and why you believe you will be a great asset for the position. Try not to focus too much on yourself and what you did in the past, but also make the connection on how the company will benefit from your experience, learnings and personality.

The *soft skills* paragraph can be a bit on the shorter site, which doesn't mean it is not important. You can impress the recruiters here by doing your homework. Check out the website of the company, read into their values and culture. Again talk about why you believe you would make a good fit to it. Also including your goals in relation to the company's goals can be a great catch. We will speak about strengths later on and you can use those here. Please note that the job descriptions usually give you a hint for what the company is looking for in a candidate.
If they are e.g. looking for an independent, creative and customer oriented developer, you should refer to those characteristics.  

Finally in the *closing* segment, maybe the most important part. This is the call-to-action part. You MUST talk about what you wish to achieve with the cover letter. Point out that you are looking for an interview, how you wish to be contacted, from when you are available and (if asked) your salary expectations. Last but not least, be kind and thank them for taking the time to read your resume and let them know you are looking forward to the answer.
