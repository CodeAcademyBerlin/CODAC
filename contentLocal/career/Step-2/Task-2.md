**Further structure of the CV**
The next elements you want to include in your resume are the following:

- Education
- projects
- Working experience
- Tech stack
- Hobbies, volunteer work etc.
- Languages

Let's go through them step by step.
Again there is no right or wrong way on how to position them in your CV.
More important is the logic behind it. If you want to put the recruiters' attention towards e.g. your training, this should be the first thing that comes up.
Most common is an achronological structure, saying the most recent thing you did should be on top. In your case, the Code Academy Berlin training. However, if you feel like for example a prior working experience makes a good match, put this first.
 
**Education & training**
Go backwards in time and maybe highlight degrees or certificates. Also add a section for extra work you put on like udemy classes, MOOCs, presentations, classes etc.
Especially in IT it is not just about degrees but knowledge you gained.
Most important, make sure that the reader can understand easily and fast.
The content or subject is more useful than the name of the university or school you attended. Therefore we suggest the following:

03/2000 - 09-2002 **Master of Science in computer science**
Hogwarts university, UK
Master Thesis: AI in magic
Grade: 1,0

What to say about Code Academy Berlin?
Follow the same example and use the right keywords:

11/2020 - 04/2021 **Data Analyst & Machine Learning**
Code Academy Berlin
Full-Time onsite training with 840h of practical training
Agile / Scrum framework in a work-like environment

You don't need to put high school diploma
Only put relevant information

**Working experience**
Follow the same structure for your working experience, be short and precise. Give some keywords, be specific and recruiters always love achievements, such as e.g.
 *Revenue increase by 70%*

01/2000-  12/2010  **Marketing assistant**
ABC Marketing, Las Vegas (US)

- Selling SaaS solutions to international clients
- Responsibility for talent development
- Successfully planned, managed and evaluated 20 events such as...

Online you will find lots of tools to check and rate your resume for SEO / ATS scores.
One of them being [TopCV](https://www.topcv.com/).

**Projects**
Besides your github Link, you should show some of the projects you did and talk about them. Make sure you describe it as specific as possible, explain the purpose and the technologies used. Also a direct link to your website or Github is a plus. 
It doesn't have to be a project you did during your class, but could be a shiny side project as well. Just make sure it is clean, has good documentation on git and it has the right looks. Put yourself in the reader's position, would he understand it?

As an example, in your resume it could look like:

**Sentiment Analysis using Big Data and Cloud Computing**
Operated the Amazon AWS cloud computing platform
Launched Elastic Map Reduce (EMR) instances for data analysis

**Tech Stack**  
Your tech stack is sort of your tool kit. Here you can show what technologies you mastered and what you feel most comfortable with. Please check back with your mentors, so you don't forget any coding language or library that might be important. 
A very common solution you can find is a rating system. Up to you, if you want to follow this example, not mandatory, but widely used.

**SEO/ ATS alert!**  Please note, using the symbols of the technologies might look cool, but could get lost by algorithms. Better write them down instead.

**Hobbies**
Not the most important part of the CV but the chance to let recruiters know more about you, interests and everything else you feel rounds up your personality. Also if you want to speak about side projects, volunteer work or events you organized.
 
Also here, try to be specific, not generic and in the best case, make a connection to the job you apply for.

e.g. **Interests:** Ted-talks, historical podcasts like Terra X, break-dance competitions

Please do not just say: reading, sleeping, eating

**Soft-Skils**
Knowing your strengths & potentials is an important skill on its own. The question comes up in almost every interview. Each personality is different and can be a valuable asset to a team. Within the workshops of the Career Service, we will talk about it in depth. For your resume, try to think about what describes you best and where you feel most comfortable. Also you can find lots of tools online to explore more about hidden talent you didn't even think of. One example is the [MBTI](https://www.16personalities.com/free-personality-test).
 
We encourage you to really take some time to think about it and not just put random skills that might sound good. The interview partners will surely ask about it and you will need to be able to explain. 
 
Please do not put: Motivated, flexible and punctual
Motivation and punctuality are self-evidence in the first place.  
Instead, create a little story e.g.:  
"Curious geek with a fable for visionary projects that will give room for my imagination and detail-oriented mindset."
