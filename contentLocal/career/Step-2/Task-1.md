First step for starting the application process is obviously your resume.
The CV is basically your business card and your most powerful tool to present to recruiters. It is supposed to give a quick overview about your background, education, projects and tech stack. Let's have a closer look.

But before we do so, please note, all we give you here are examples and best practise suggestions. But there is not THE right way to create a CV. In the end it is YOUR resume and you should be happy with it and feel comfortable talking it over in the interview.
Also we want you to *adjust and taylor* your CV every time you apply to the position and company you choose. A recruiter looks at thousands of resumes in his life. They can smell if you put some effort in your application and CV or not. And every minute you put in adjustments and extra work will increase your chances by far.

However, there are some minimum requirements that your resume should include.
We will tackle them one by one.

**Design**
When it comes to the looks of your CV, again there is no golden way you need to follow.
The sky's the limit. You can find hundreds of templates, suggestions or ideas to get inspired from online. One of my favorite websites overall when it comes to templates is [canva](https://www.canva.com/).  Here you can find great CV templates to use for your resume, it's free and easy to edit.

Also here you can find to attached examples for your inspiration:

**Personal information**
When it comes to personal information, you **must** add the following information:

- Full name
- Address
- Professional email / usually "last name. first name at ..."
- Phone number
- Github Link
- If non European - Status of your work permit

**Nice to have:**

- Additional links to social media, webside, blogs etc. 
- Additional personal statement with the most important info about you (1line) 

 **Optional:**

- Marital status
- Nationality
- date / place of birth
- degree, title
  
**Do NOT put**

- religion
- sexual orientation
- Name/profession of parents

**The picture question**
Photos are still quite common in Germany. But they are not mandatory. Be aware that if you apply to an international franchise, they might not allow it though, especially in the US.
My personal opinion, a professional picture can do no harm. Please don't use selfies or cut pictures. Also a smile always helps.

**Professional summary**
Your professional summary is a short pitch you give about yourself towards your possible employer. It covers your education, experience, goals and what you are offering to the company. Also you are doing recruiters a favor and ease their job by saving them time. Speed is king as a recruiter. If they don't use ATS or SEO to preselect, they spend less than one minute with your CV, so you kind of want to make sure, your summary blows them away in no time.
 
Advise: Usually companies have a section on their website, where they talk about themselves, values or even have a whole application section. Check it out and use it wisely to make a connection from your CV to the open position. Always try to create a benefit for the company. As you might guess, time to taylor.  Adjust every time to the position and company you apply for.
 
To sum up:
- Introduce yourself with name, profession, experience
- Talk about your goals and how you want to help the company grow
- Be short, precise and snappy
- Try to create a benefit for the recruiter
- Adjust every time

 Don'ts
 
- Don't start with "I am..."
- Don't be generic
- Don't just talk about you - make a bridge to the position/company

SEO & ATS
 The recruiting process gets more and more automated. Automatic tracking systems (ATS) and search engine optimization help to scan, rate and choose candidates. The higher your score, the bigger your chances to get an invite for a job interview. 
 By tailoring your CV and using keywords from the job description, you can use this system in your favor. Read more about it [here](https://zety.com/uk/blog/cv-summary).
