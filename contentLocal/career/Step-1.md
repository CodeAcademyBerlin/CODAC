In the first step we want you to learn more about the local market, think about where you believe you want to work and what is important to know before signing a contract.  
Let's have a look at how working in Germany usually looks like.

The vaste majority of employees works in postions with fixed contracts (Anstellung). Germany is not really a freelancing country. However, with the Tech sector growing, the percentage of self-employment is increasing as well and slowly authorities or insurances are adopting towards it. For more detailed information about the demographics of labour please read further [here](https://www.destatis.de/DE/Themen/Arbeit/Arbeitsmarkt/Erwerbstaetigkeit/_inhalt.html).

_Working hours_

The average working hours sum up around 35-40h per week, depending on your company, mostly Monday to Friday. Part-time or project based employment is generally possible but not very common.

_Company demographics_

When you first think of Germany, most likely the companies that might come into your mind are the big ones like Lufthansa, Siemens or Volkswagen. But you might be surprised to hear that the back bone of the german industry has always been the so called KMUs (Kleine und mittlere Unternehmen) SMEs. Those mostly high specialized and often family owned businesses make more than 90% of the GDP. The biggest sector of employment is the public sector.
Let's take a look at the actual demographics of the most valuble companies in Germany. As you can see in this map, most HQs are not located in Berlin, but more often in the West and South:

_Why is this important to know?_

The map gives quiet a good impression of the proportions on the job market in Germany. The south-west is definetly the strongest segment in the country. However, does this implement the IT industry as well? Only to some degree to be honest. As you will see, Berlin has a very buzzing comunity. But later one, you will see the difference in the saleries, plus the competition is much less dense than in the capital. So we are asking you to take this into consideration. A lot of companies in the south of Germany offer great onboarding, support in re-locating and in times of remote work, you might not even need to move. On the other hand, english might not be as common, especially when dealing with customers.

_Berlin_

Our capital is an important location for tech talent, especially known for the start-ups and it's important meaning for innovation hubs. By now, some of the most important players in the IT field like Zalando, Delivery Hero, N26 or Hello Fresh are Berlin made.  
More and more global players are building branches here now as well, Tesla with the Giga factory, the Siemens campus and the upcoming Amazon tower on Warschauer Brücke.  
3 out of 5 start-ups in Germany were founded in Berlin, creating 80.000 jobs, generating 3.7bilion € in investments and 37% of growth, especially in Fin-Tech and SaaS. The city of Berlin is pushing the industry and tries to attract talent from all over the world, especially with the help of the [Berlin Partner für Wirtschaft und Technologie.](https://www.businesslocationcenter.de/startups-berlin/)

Berlin is very famous for its growing start-up community, a new start-up is founded every 20mins here. Every year, new exciting companies come to life and enrich the Tech scene.
