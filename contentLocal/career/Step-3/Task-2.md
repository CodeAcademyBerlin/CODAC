Every interview you will ever have will start with a short introduction of yourself. Or a pitch.
Often you will have a first screening interview with HR / Recruiter who want to understand a bit better your background, availability, salary expectations etc.

It is always good to have your “pitch” prepared. But what makes a good pitch?

The general idea of pitching refers more to presenting an (business) idea to a possible partner or investor. The framework in the job context stays the same. You have limited time (3-5mins) to explain your background, business idea or in our context, your brand.
Since most likely the recruiters have at least screened your CV before, they want to learn more about you as a person.

- What are your driving forces?
- Why did you decide to make a career change towards Tech?
- What did you study / learn, biggest challenges, UPS (unique selling point)  etc.
- What are your achievements, goals, how can the company benefit from your expertise?

As you can see, for your pitch, you do not only repeat your CV, they know that already. It is all about the “why?” The pitch / intro of yourself is more about connecting the dots and telling your story.

So how should your pitch be prepared?
