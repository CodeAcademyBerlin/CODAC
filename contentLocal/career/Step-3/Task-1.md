THE most important source for seeking jobs and professional networking is without a doubt LinkedIn. We show you how to rock your profile and how you can profit from the further benefits of the plattform.

**What is LinkedIn for:**

- Job seeking
- Building a professional network
- Create and read content
- showcasing your service

Think of your profile as your business card. A huge majority of your internal and external contacts will evaluate you over this option. We want to make sure to give the best possible impression and show off your most shiny side.
 
## Let's create your profile:

Once you registered and mastered the first step of introductions of LinkedIn, you can follow these guidelines to improve your profile. For best practice, we will take a look at these bullet points:

- Profile photo & background
- Headline
- Summary
- Professional experience
- Skillset
- Endorsement
- Visibility

We spoke about the *photo* in the CV section already. The same applies here.
Please make sure to upload a high-resolution & professional picture. And smile :-)
Don't: Selfies, pets, hats, comics etc.

For your *background banner*, get rid of the blue. Take something related to coding or e.g. data visualization, you presenting etc. Be creative and brand yourself.
 
The individual headline is what people will see first when searching for your name or position. Be aware that most traffic on LinkedIn comes from the mobile app. So the search bar is very important. Make sure to use it wisely. Give the reader the most important information you want to share with them. For example:
 
Data Scientist | Python enthusiast | Master of Arts
or be creative and write a short pitch
'Brandnew bootcamp graduate in love with back-end technologies with out-of-the-box solutions"
 
The *summary* or *About* section is a longer version of your headline. 
Here you can post a short pitch about yourself. Try to make it meaningful and add value to a possible recruiter. It should contain a specific short story that is easy to understand and to follow. Try to create a benefit for anybody who might be interested in hiring you. E.g. "....with a degree in and freshly acquired Python skills, eager to get involved in an exciting Start-up to help it reach the next level."
 
The *skills* segment.
LinkedIn allows you to choose three main or Top skills and up to 50 additional skills that describe you best. Be smart and try to find the most useful ones. A great source is open job descriptions to get inspired. Also add as many as you possibly can think of, in the additional part and get endorsement for them. Also you can request recommendations, which I believe is a much stronger argument towards you. For your dream job you should add all required skills before applying so you look like a better match for the algorithm or ATS. In general, the skill segment is losing importance, so most recruiters don't look at it too deeply.

A nice way to polish your profile is by *endorsing* them as a proof. Team-up with your fellow students and support each other:

*Networking* and *social selling 101* is the most important part of LinkedIn. In the end growing your network means more insights on the Tech community, staying up to date on what's happening in your network and more opportunities to get hired.
When you send a connection request, use the 'add a message' option, it is much more likely for the others to accept. But please don't sell right away or beg for a job.

As a first step, try to grow your network to more than 500 people.
We will show you how. 
First follow [these](https://www.seedtable.com/startups-berlin) start-ups.
Now you have two options to make connections on their company side. The more random one, you could just connect to some employees you find interesting:

A second option is the so called *chain search*. It doesn't only work to find people, but also for groups, jobs, posts, schools, events or other content.
You can combine different key words by adding an AND in between.

Should I also connect with people I don't know? Absolutely yes!
Especially in companies you want to apply for, it is a good source of information and insights and networking is THE best option for you to get a job.

Finally learn to use the *job search* engine. You can use the filter system in your favor, set an alarm that allows you to be under the first applicants and gives you lots of data that you can use to improve your profile. Good hunting!
