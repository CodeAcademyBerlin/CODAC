### üë©‚Äçüíª The module

In this module, you will get introduced to more advanced technologies and concepts and you will have to work on your final project.

During the first week you can choose between an introduction to Natural Language Processing and Deep Learning, and a small Data Pipeline project. You can of course read and try both, but by the end of the first week you will have to choose the topic of your final project. You will have 3 more weeks to work on it, and you will have a presentation at the end.

The final project is the most important project of the course. Here is where you can apply all the knowledge you have gained in the past 4 months. The topic is completely free and up to you, and before starting working on it you should discuss it with your mentor.

We have outlined 2 possible final projects, which reflects 2 different positions you could have on the job market.

##### Data / Business Analyst

Take a business / domain that interests you and analyze it. You can find a lot of free dataset on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets)

Use all the tools / techologies that you want, and learn new ones if you want. Use some simple Machine Learning predictions to spice you analysis up.

##### Data Engineer Project

Build a data pipeline and show meaningful insights through the world wide web (you can use Streamlit or Plotly for showing plots, or Flask to make an interactive web app).
