Welcome to the **Project 2** which focuses on Python and Statistics core concepts and its applications in Machine Learning. You will work as a "Junior Data Analyst" in the **Analytics & Research** department of **CODE Analytics**.

**BlueBerry Winery**'s team, a start-up wine maker in Portugal, has approached our company to help them build a **Wine Quality Analytics System** to help them **determine the quality of the wines produced based on their composition**.

Like any modern start-up company, BlueBerry Winery is trying to enter the business with a good amount of analytics and research on domain knowledge. Many wine companies fail because they do not start with preliminary quality research neither on the market nor on their product. With the advancement of technology, more and more companies trust data and machine learning to come to a decision instead of expert recommendation / analysis.

From a sales and marketing perspective, it is of utmost priority to put a proper price tag for a bottle of wine so that there is no mismatch between quality and price of the product, one of the major factors contributing to 'Customer Satisfaction'.

Other factors contribute to the quality. The age of a bottle of wine, for example, plays a significant role as time changes the taste of the fruit flavours in a wine as well as reduces the acidity and tannin in a wine. As the acidity and tannin are reduced, the wine becomes rounder and smoother. The analysis should not restrict to the technical specifications but include the business / domain aspects so that it can help BlueBerry Winery make business decisions.

As an intern, your task will be to prepare the data to be fitted to a Machine Learning algorithm, analyse the data taking into consideration the business questions and present your findings.

Some of the questions you could ask yourself are:

- Are there any problems with the data (null values, outliers, sufficient amount of data, etc.)?

- Is the chemical composition of red and white wines comparable?

- Does the chemical composition have any impact on the perceived quality of the wine?

- What are your observations?

You would be provided with all the guidance from time to time in the beginning, however, **you have to research and self-learn as much as possible**.

**Completion Time**: 4 weeks
