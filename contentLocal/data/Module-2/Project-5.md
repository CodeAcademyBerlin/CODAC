Welcome to the **Project 5**.

VS Group want to set up their online business across EU and is seeking your knowledge in understanding what works best for them. They would like to understand which products, regions, categories and customer segments they should target or avoid.

Although the parent company is very famous in agriculture and food businesses, they apparently do not have any background in e-commerce businesses.

A lot of companies do a through research on competitors irrespective of the fact whether the company is a start-up or already into the business. This kind of competitive analysis can be defined as a process of identifying your competitors and evaluating their strategies to determine their strengths (e.g., highest selling products, ads strategy etc.) and weaknesses(e.g., part of the year when sales volume is real low, high shiping costs for some regions etc.) relative to your own business, product, and service.

The goal of the competitive analysis is to gather the insights necessary to find a line of attack and develop your go-to-market strategy.

This task requires you to understand the domain beforehand:

- Basic overview of e-Commerce business model
- Name of top 3 e-Commerce retailers in Germany
- Can you think of some of the possible competitors who might be interesting to analyse.

This project is divided into three parts:

- First, you will have to explore and answer some questions about the dataset using SQL.

- Then, you will complete your e-Commerce project using Python and will perform an EDA of the dataset and present KPI suggestions.

- You will work on an unsupervised Machine Learning technique called Clustering, used to understand customers behavior based on similar patterns.

- In the last week of the project you will learn how to use Tableau to create interactive plots and dashboards.

**Completion Time**: 3 weeks
