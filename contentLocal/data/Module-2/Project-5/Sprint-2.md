This week you'll work on the e-commerce EDA using Python. **You will use a Python SQL connector in order to perform queries on your newly created databse.**

This is your third EDA, so we are confident that you can easily do this. This time also you will create a PowerPoint report at the end of the project that will be presented to the management team of 'VS Group' and they would like to see how much you have understood the e-commerce business and analysed the data keeping in mind all the KPIs.

### Epic 1: the exploratory data analysis

There are plenty of interesting insights in this data. Here are some ideas of information that you could present to the team:

- What is the customer buying pattern? Per day of the week, weekly, monthly, quaterly, yearly, etc.

- Are there any specific days/months/quarters when the sales have been unusually high / low and what could be the possible reasons? How about the profit?

- Which states and which customers made the highest number of orders? Are they the same with the highest spending?

- Can you try to make a map showing the 5 states generating the max sales revenue?

- Can we see the quarterly revenue behaviour?

- Can you create a plot showing the growth rate of new customers over the months?

- What do you think about the customers? Are they individuals or wholesalers? Why would you say so?

- Are there any issues with the dataset?

**You don't have to create all these plots. Choose the most relevant ones for your analysis.**

**Optional: make a small selection of the plots and try to present them as plotly express animations. Please remember that the most important thing is to make a good analysis, independently of which library you use to create your graphs.**

### Epic 2: Suggest meaningful KPIs for VS Group's business

A KPI, or key performance indicator, is a quantifiable measure of performance over time for a specific objective. They are commonly written using th S.M.A.R.T. technique:

- Specific: what exactly are you trying to achieve?

- Measurable: what are the metrics of evaluation?

- Achievable: what is needed to accomplish this KPI? Does the company have the ability to reach this goal? If not, what needs to done and can it be solved in a sensible time?

- Relevant: how does it help your overall business objectives?

- Time-bound: what is your timeframe?

Taking all this information into consideration, present 2-4 KPIs that you think would add value to VS Electronics in their business.
