Data science is one of the rapidly growing fields that demand a data scientist growing up daily. As of 2021, I can't see this demand slowing down anytime soon. It is an interdisciplinary field that can help us analyze the data around us to make our life better and our future brighter.

Luckily, becoming a data science professional (Data Analyst / BI Analyst / Data Engineer) does not require a degree.
As long as you are open to learning new things and willing to put in the effort and time, you can become a data professional.

The question now is, where to start?

"The beginning is perhaps more difficult than anything else, but keep heart, it will turn out all right."

### üè¢ Careers in Data Science

The job roles have different names and different responsibilities.

### üë©‚Äçüíª The module

In this module, you will learn the tools to land a job as a Junior Data Analyst. Data analysts can work on multiple domains and roles depending on the job title or organisation.

The basic steps for most analysts would be to obtain quality data, then process, design, and present it in ways to help people, businesses, and organizations make better decisions. For example, Marketing Analysts collect and store data on sales numbers, market research, or customer behaviors. Product Analysts bring technical expertise to ensure the quality of the products; in a similar way Operation Analysts try to improve the overall operations of the organizations. However, all of them fundamentally work with the analysis of Data and try to find key insights from the available data.

### ‚åõ Length : 3 Months

### üéØ Learning Objectives

- Learn the basics of Tableau

- Learn the basics of Python, Statistics and other Python libraries (Numpy and Pandas)

- Apply all this knowledge on 2 realistic projects - Consulting companies about their businesses

- Use basics of Machine Learning to make predictions and support your hypothesis

- Learn SQL and use it to make insightful analysis of a specific dataset

Major tools that are being used from day to day activities might vary based on the size of the organization and the business. LinkedIn survey shows Python is becoming one of the most used and favored tools of all time. As all companies store the data in some format, SQL is a key skill that most employers would like to see in your portfolio. That is why the Data Analyst course focuses a lot on Python & SQL along with an introduction to Machine Learning.

The challenges a Data Analyst faces are very often the lack of good data or quality data. That is why some professionals claim "Data Cleaning" as the most time consuming of all the tasks and we, at Code Academy Berlin, designed the course in such a way that you get challenged often (almost every day), and do a lot of 'Data Cleaning' towards the end of the module.
