## Epic 1: Responsiveness (Optional)

Make your website responsive for only one phone size. If you are using Bootstrap Grid you will be able to change the grid structure based on some specific breakpoints!  
Another important aspect of Responsiveness is that on phone sizes you want to show less information, and use click events to show more. You can get the device size ([https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_window_screen.asp](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_window_screen.asp)) and decide what functions to call to modify the DOM.

### Media query

You can use also Media query to override CSS classes: [https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_mediaqueries_ex.asp](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_mediaqueries_ex.asp)

## Epic 2: Presentation, code review, and refactoring
