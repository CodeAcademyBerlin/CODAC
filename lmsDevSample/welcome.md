# 🌄Welcome the Code Academy Berlin LMS Platform

### 🧭 During the next 3 to 5 months the CA Berlin team will guide you through the journey into becoming a web developer or data scientist.

Although it won’t be an easy task, through commitment and dedication to the work we ensure you that our immersive courses will give you all the tools necessary to find a job.

### 📚 This platform will guide you through the different tasks that are expected from you in the projects. It will not however provide you the solutions to your problems.

Indeed, our story centered methodology is a project-based, problem-solving approach. This means you will have to research on your own solutions to each problem by your own means.
This might seem scary at first but is necessary in obtaining the coding logic that is fundamental to become a developer or data scientist.

### 👩‍🏫 It can however happen that you are not able to find the answers you need.

You will then have the possibility to book an appointment with one of your mentor whom will guide you through materials and solutions to explore.
To do so you will use the platform Calendlys where it is important that you explain your issue and how you tried to solve it.
[Mentor's page of the platform](./mentors) (left menu).

### 📈 Each of the project development structure is adapted from the widely used Agile Scrum methodology, today present in most IT companies.

Hence, you will work on different features in small increments of 5 to 8 days called sprints. Projects are usually between 1 and 5 sprints.

### 📋 You will use Trello management and planning tool to track a backlog of tasks.

Your day will start with a daily 10 min stand up meeting where each student will talk about his work from the previous day with mentors and identify potential blockers that were encountered before briefly explaining the plan of action for the day.
Every now and then, you will also have spikes. These are short and dynamic presentations led by mentors to clarify known difficulties or blockers identified during stand ups.

### 🏋️‍♂️ At the end of every project, you will present in front of the group your project as if it were a presentation for a client.

Then mentors will give you feedback and code review.

### 💻 This platform, its content, as well as our marketing website is home grown and fully made by the team. As part of Code Academy Berlin we give you full access to our source code on our GitHub.

We cherish the open-source attitude and trust you to respect not to share this content outside of the academy.

### 📢 We also encourage you to report any issues, typos broken links in the content by creating a GitHub issue on the corresponding page. You will find the direct link at the top.
