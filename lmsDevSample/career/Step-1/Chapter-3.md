## How to read a job post

Reading job descriptions seems harder than it is.
Usually they are devided in several segments, which usually contain the following:

- **Job Title**
- **Company description**

  Here already you will given important information on what is the product of th company, plus it's values & goals.
  When writting your application you should definetly try to refer to this part.

- **Job summary, location, responsibilities, qualifications needed**

  This part is by far the most importante piece of the job add. Try to match the major parts in your application.  
  So do your homework, research on the company for news, their values and try to get a feeling for the vibe of the company.  
  Match the most relevant points either in your cover letter, the summary part of your CV or in the inital email.  
  You do not need to match all of the responsibilities mentioned in the job description. Especially the very commen 3-5 years of experience, you can easily ignore.

- **Salary, Visa status, benefits**

  Usually the final paragraph gives you an overview on further information like remote options, or Part-time/Full-time.  
  Most likely the salary will not be mentioned, you should compare on glassdoor or gehaltsvergleich.de to have an idea ready on how much you want to earn.  
  We will take a closer look on entry level salaries by position in the next slides.
