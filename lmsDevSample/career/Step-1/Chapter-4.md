## Working in Germany

## Anstellung | Fixed contracts

The vast majority of employees in Germany work on fixed contracts with an average of 40 hours per week, full-time.  
Contracts are often limited to 1 or 2 years but could be unlimited as well.  
There are no strict regulations for holidays, but the common number is between 25-35 days per year, which doesn't include public holidays.  
Normally your salary will be transfered by the end of the month, be aware of the difference between Brutto (before taxes) and Netto (which is the amount ending up on your account).  
We will have a closer look at the salaries later, for now just be aware, that income tax, social and health insurance will be deducted automatically.  
Mnemonic: The difference between Brutto and Netto is roughly 1/3 of your salary.  
You can check your gross salary [here](http://www.brutto-netto-rechner.info/)

The first six months of your contract will usually be the probation period, where both sides have easier rights to end the contract. Most likely within a week of notification.  
Once you got through this, the notification time will increase from 4 weeks within the first two years of employment up to 7 months if you stay with the same company for 20 years.  
In the public sector, you will find even more detailed laws in your favor, plus a well-organized Union and further benefits.

All over Germany, you can find the [Lohsteuerhilfeverein](https://www.vlh.de/) who support you on all questions about taxing & income.

**Internship**

A good first step to entering a company might be an internship. Usually, they last around 3-6 months and are a nice way to get your foot in the door. Most companies pay the minimum wage here, which would be around 1600€ gross / month. But it is not a must-have by default. A good side to find internships is e.g. [Campusjaeger.](https://www.campusjaeger.de/)

**Trainee**

A Traineeship is the bigger brother to an internship. They last around 1-2 years and are packed with training, mentoring, and lots of learning. Perfect for a graduate and usually well paid from the start. Also, the idea is, that you get to know different positions & departments to find out which role you best fit in. The catch is, that you have to apply quite early, competition is tense and they are not as easy to find. Keep your eyes open on all these platforms, also we try to keep you posted in our social media groups.

**Werkstudent**

Last but not least, we have the option to sign as a working student. This only applies to students who are enrolled in university. You can now apply for Werkstudent positions and do some part-time work or write your thesis with a company, paid as well. Werkstudenten are very popular for companies, since the employer has to pay less into social benefits.

## Salaries

Negotiating salaries will always be part of your interview process. Even so, companies become more transparent with salaries, most likely they will not reveal what they offer usually. Therefore make sure to know what you would like to ask.  
Especially when working with recruiters, they want to have a fixed number.

Be aware the payments may differ due to your working experience, academic background, and experience in leading positions. We would recommend giving a range, which could be 55-60k € / year brutto for Data Analyst roles and around 40-45k € for Web Developers on average.  
Always cross-check with Glassdoor or Gehaltsvergleich. Also, LinkedIn Premium can give you more insights.

## Freelancing and Self-Employment

Germany is not a country designed for freelancing. On the other hand is also not as hard as you might think.
We have to distinguish between several different forms of self-employed which have a major impact on taxing and your health insurance.
Before starting your business, we strongly advise you to get support from a business coach, especially in the different forms of companies.
For now let's have a closer look at the differences between freelance and self-employed.

What does **freelancing** or **Freiberuflichkeit** mean?

As a freelancer, you usually work on your own, project-based, or within the framework of a temporary employment relationship.  
In the long run, you are supposed to have more than one client and not work in a dependent relationship.  
You will need a VAT number from your Finanzamt to issue invoices, but you do not need to open a business and pay business taxes as long as you provide services and don't sell a product.  
To get started, you will need to talk with your health insurance. Be aware there are major differences in pricing.  
Social Security is not mandatory, but I recommend paying it voluntarily within the first three months of starting as a freelancer.  
Retirement insurance might be obligatory, depending on your business model and profession.

**Self-Employment**

By self-employment, we mean running your Start-up and setting up a business, which is mandatory to work self-employed.  
You have the responsibility for your company and all the entrepreneurial risk. In addition to the freelancing path, you will have to pay as well business tax
and run detailed accounting.  
The good news is, that you are all free when it comes to choosing your clients, ways of marketing, designing your product etc.  
Generally speaking, self-employments refers to more business rather than project-based work and comes with a lot of responsibilities.  
Again, consulting a coach or agency is advised before getting started, especially for the taxing part.

**Taxing for Freelancers**

Speaking of which.

Taxing in any kind of self-employed/ freelancing activity is way more complicated than being employed.  
Basically, you are paying taxes on three different time axes. In the first year, you will need to estimate what is going to be your income, and pay taxes accordingly.  
The same goes for your health insurance. This is the first axis of payments.  
Once the business year is finished, you will have to do your tax declaration and submit it to the Finanzamt. Once you received your Tax assessment notice (Steuerbescheid), you will know how much you earned.  
This can have a good outcome, meaning you will get money back for taxes and insurance. Or if you estimated too low, you have to pay accordingly. Also, try to keep some reserves.  
The hardest part of self-employment is always understanding how much of your income belongs to you. This is axis number 2.  
The third one is the VAT. This you will have to pay quarterly in advance. Sounds terrible, but it prevents you from getting bad surprised by the end of the year.

All of it sounds very complicated, however, once you get the hang of it, it is okay to manage.  
Still, the support of a tax advisor would be recommended, as well as a modern accounting software.  
There is good news as well. Most of your expenses like phone, internet, and sometimes even part of your rent can lower the amount of taxes to pay.  
If your revenue stays under 22.000 € per year, you don't need to pay any taxes at all.  
But usually, one would calculate that 2/3 of your income goes into taxes + insurance.
