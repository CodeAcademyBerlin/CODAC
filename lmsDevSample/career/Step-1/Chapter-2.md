## Defining your goal

First of all, we would like to find out what you consider most important for your new role.
This includes different layers that you might want to take into account. And by account, we do not necessarily mean salary.  
Try to find out for yourself what has the biggest value when you think of the framework of your job. This can be anything from e.g. flexible working hours, a mentor to learn from, work/life balance, a green technology product, or the purpose of the company. So the idea would be to create the best possible workplace you can imagine. The sky is the limit!

Also do not just think of your first job, but what would be your ideal role in the future. For now, it doesn't matter how you will achieve those jobs, it is simply important that you have an idea of where you are heading and why.

In the first segment of Career Week, we spoke about the market, the different opportunities, and slowly established this road map.  
Are you more the digital nomad kind of person, which is already dreaming about coding while sipping on a cocktail,
or do you maybe prefer a more structured and well-organized life under the umbrella of a corporate company? As food for thought, you can get inspiration from this video, by considering the possible scenarios you will meet in different surroundings:

[Joshua Fluke](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9GVPdIeFCY) is a great source to learn more about the hiring process for coding academy graduates in the first place.

## The ideal workplace

The video introduces different company forms. Let's do the reality check right away.  
We won't talk about pros & cons here, since this is on you to decide anyways.  
But let's take a closer look at the landscape of employers you will most likely meet in Germany and Berlin especially.  
When you think of Germany, probably huge companies like Siemens, Mercedes, or Lufthansa would come to your mind first.  
For sure they have a major impact on the landscape of german employers, however, the backbone of the industry has always been the SMEs (small and medium enterprises with less than 250 employees), where over 60% of the workforce are at home in Germany.  
Many of those SMEs are family-ownded and highly specialized companies with long traditions and often experts in their field.

Having this in mind, what does it mean for you and can one determine a general difference between a corporate company, SME, and start-up?  
The question probably lies somewhere in the middle, some frameworks and prejudices about various company sizes might even be true.  
In the end, you will have to define what is most important for you and cross-check with the information you can find about your future employer.

Try to write down a list of what is most important for you and rate your employer accordingly.  
This should answer some of the following questions for you:

- Will I start in a more dynamic or static role? Where would I bring in my talents the best and feel most comfortable?
- Is the role of more a specialist or generalistic character?
- What perks do I need? (e.g. remote/ hybrid work, mentoring, flat hierarchies, 13th salary, growth opportunities, etc?)
- Can I identify with their values and product? Do I get ownership for my projects?
- Am I willing to travel or relocate for a job?

As you see, there are many ways to define the right position for you. We strongly advise you to write down your priorities.  
Especially relocating could be an interesting option since first of all the competition is much less dense in the south of Germany, plus salaries are still a bit higher, according to the cost of living.

## Berlin - The start-up capital

Our capital is an important location for tech talent, especially known for the start-ups and its important meaning for innovation hubs.  
By now, some of the important players in the IT field like Zalando, gorillas, Delivery Hero, N26, or Hello Fresh are Berlin-made.  
More and more global players are building branches here now as well, Tesla with the Gigafactory, the Siemens campus, and the upcoming Amazon tower on Warschauer Brücke.
3 out of 5 start-ups in Germany were founded in Berlin, creating 80.000 jobs, generating 3.7 billion € in investments, and 37% of growth, especially in Fintech and SaaS. And they keep growing each year.

In 2020 some start-ups made it already into the Top 100 companies with most employees, for example:

Zalando: 7k employees

Amazon: 2,5k employees

Delivery Hero: 1,7k employees

N26: 1,5k employes

Speaking of finding jobs, let's dive deeper into more sources for the job search in the next chapter.
