## Welcome to the Career Services

Everyone has a unique perspective on what to expect from their future job, which dreams to follow, and which path to take.  
In the following sessions, which reproduce the workshops of the Career Week, we will support you in following those ideas, giving you the toolbox to create your own roadmap and achieve your goals.

There are many options to choose from, many paths to follow, and a lot of different job titles to select.  
We really would like you to think about it as a journey. Don't focus on your first job only, but think about your career and where you want to head in the long run. Applying for a first position can already affect your destiny.

Our partner Eden Whitcomb of -Peritus Partners- can give you some advice [here](https://mtor.io/) and he built this presentation to create your own [Career Roadmap](staticAsset/career/peritus.pdf)

Hopefully, the upcoming information, tools, tips, and insights help you making your decision on where you can shine the most.  
It is more of a process that can start here and will continue over the next years.  
During career week as well as in the following chapters we would like to help you answering yourself some of the questions which we believe can arise out of your learnings along the way.

Along the way, we introduced different tools like the Career Roadmap above, [SWOT Analysis](https://www.thecoachingtoolscompany.com/what-is-a-swot-analysis-everything-you-need-to-know/) or the Hell & Heaven approach.  
Which technique fits you best, is of course for you to decide. However, we strongly advise you to write down a mock-down for your career.  
It will help you structure the job hunt, define the path to follow, and prepare you for interviews to come.  
To guide you through this process of defining your personal goals, we will use the [G R O W model](https://www.agilecentre.com/resources/article/grow-model-explained/) out of the agile/ SCRUM methodology to get you started.  
We suggest writing down your learnings and coming up with a game plan to follow.
Fill those four categories with life and establish your personal framework.

### Goal

Each of you has a personal idea, goal, or vision you would like to achieve, and that made you decide to sign up for a career-changing program in coding.  
This could be a better salary, gaining purpose, sustainability, and so much more.  
Write down the driving forces that made you take this important step in your career and what you hope to achieve.

### Reality

In the next step, we will do a reality check and try to answer some questions for ourselves.
Where can I most likely achieve my goals and what does the market require me to bring to get there?  
Research is required to get an impression of what is expected in your first role as a Junior.
We are talking about the _hard skills_ like in-demand coding languages, presenting to customers or project-management as well as _soft skills_ such as time management, critical thinking and adaptability.  
So we will take a closer look at the German market, different working models and what you should take into consideration in general.

### Options

In the options part, we will set milestones and think about the things we need to prepare to achieve the goals.  
Mainly we will focus on your CV, and cover letter, setting up a LinkedIn profile, and working on your storytelling in the interview.

### Way forward

The last step is your personal strategy or game plan.  
What WILL you do to achieve your goal? Again this is all on you to decide.  
How to structure your progress, how to track it and keeping your spirits up.

Alright. Let's get going then and start with defining your personal goal.
