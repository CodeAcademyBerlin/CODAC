  ## Directories organization

### src

For a better organization, the code is organized inside the `src` folder, while the configuration files and the `public` directory are located at the root level.

[This is supported by Next.js by default](https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/src-directory).

### lmsDevSample

This folder contains extract from the LMS content for testing.
Actual content is cloned from github in production

### **test**

You can use this directory for your integration tests with Jest

### cypress

e2e (and/or integration) tests and fixtures for Cypress

### .storybook

Configuration files for Storybook

### .github/workflows
