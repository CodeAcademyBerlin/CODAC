# Welcome to Toxic-UI

This is our collection of pre-made tailwind components using react/typescript.
That makes it easy to develop hard-to-reach states. Save these UI states as **stories** to revisit during development, testing, or QA.

Toxic-UI is a set of fun, interactive, and intuitive UI components built with React, Tailwind, and TypeScript. Our goal is to make it easy for students (and mentors) to create beautiful and responsive user interfaces for their projects.
