## Epic 1: Registration/LogIn Page with Firebase

Firebase is a Google platform that you can use to have a managed backend infrastructure without having to write it yourself. In this project you will use it to Authenticate users and store your chat messages in a Firebase databse.

[Create a Firebase project](https://firebase.google.com/docs/web/setup)

[Firebase Authentication docs](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/web/start)

Remember you need to activate the service on your firebase Console project.

## Epic 2: Firestore and Chat

[Cloud Firestore](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/quickstart)

- Store the chat messages and its author
- Lock the Chat Page so that users can access it only when logged in. If they are not logged in they should be redirected to the LogIn component.

## Epic 3: Google Authentication (optional)
