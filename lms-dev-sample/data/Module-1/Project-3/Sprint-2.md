## Epic 1: Trip History data

During the last project, you were direcly provided with the exact dataset (For example, Price & Reviews DataSet). This time, it is your task to look for relevant data on the client website.

The have a section on the website with the [Trip History Data](https://www.capitalbikeshare.com/system-data)

Each quarter, theye publish a downloadable file with trip data. The data includes:

- Duration – Duration of trip
- Start Date – Includes start date and time
- End Date – Includes end date and time
- Start Station – Includes starting station name and number
- End Station – Includes ending station name and number
- Bike Number – Includes ID number of bike used for the trip
- Member Type – Indicates whether user was a "registered" member (Annual Member, 30-Day Member or Day Key Member) or a "casual" rider (Single Trip, 24-Hour Pass, 3-Day Pass or 5-Day Pass)

Make use of these informations to enrich your findings / forecast.

## Epic 2: KPIs

Knowing the right Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and understanding them is vital to the health and success of a business.

However, when we onboard new clients, we find that a good proportion of them are uncertain about what they should be measuring and how they can use these powerful tools.

Effective KPIs are important metrics to ensure that one can accomplish the business objective.

[This article describes the concepts of KPIs](https://www.klipfolio.com/resources/articles/what-is-a-key-performance-indicator)

**Write down 3-5 KPIs which you would like to measure and understand before the presentation.**

_Also, do not forget to explain them in the context of the project._

Hint:

- Trip duration is a good measure, but it does not take into account how many bikers made the trips. To include them you would rather measure trip duration per trip.

**_Choose your KPI wisely so that it reflects a measure valuable for the business._**

- As explanation of your time series forecast (decline/increase in customers base), you can have a look at [customer reviews on app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.motivateco.capitalbikeshare&hl=en&gl=US&showAllReviews=true)

For a coding bootcamp, how many students get to complete the program once they started/joined the academy would be good measure of external KPI.

What is the attendance rate of a student in a class would be an example of internal KPI.

According to optimizesmart.com

'External KPIs are set at the department/team/function level and focus on measuring the overall performance of a department/team. ... Internal KPIs are set at an individual level and focus on measuring the overall performance of an individual'
