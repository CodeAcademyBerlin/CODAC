Qraph QL a query language where you define a schema for your data then tell graph QL how to fetch and supply that schema.
We will learn the fundamental concepts of graph QL by interacting with the public space X API and focus on writing a React app that uses GraphQL to render this data.

## GraphQl Explorer

Most of the time, implementation of a GraphQl app comes with setting up an interface called Explorer to easily visualise all the queries a backend implementation could provide.
Find below the explorer for a api to query SpaceX data.

## Apollo

Apollo is the most popular GraphQL implementation tool, it simplifies app development. It has libraries for many different languages and frameworks.
We will here use the library dedicated to React Client : `@apollo/client` as well as the `graphql` library. We can install both together by running: `npm i @apollo/client graphql`.

[Apollo React Documentation](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react)

## Setting up the provider

The library works using Reack Hooks in a similar way of a Context that can distribute GraphQL capabilities to all of our application.
We start by setting up the configuration and wrap ou provider around the App.

```js
import {
  ApolloClient,
  InMemoryCache,
  ApolloProvider,

} from "@apollo/client";
import { LaunchsList } from './components/LaunchsList'


const client = new ApolloClient({
  uri: "https://api.spacex.land/graphql",
  cache: new InMemoryCache()
});


function App() {
  return (
    <ApolloProvider client={client}>
      <div>
        <h2>My first Apollo app ðŸš€</h2>
        <LaunchsList />
      </div>
    </ApolloProvider>
  );
}

export default App;
```

## GraphQl components

```js
import React from 'react'
import {
    useQuery,
    gql
} from "@apollo/client";



export const LaunchsList = () => {
    const { loading, error, data } = useQuery(gql`
    {
      launchesPast(limit: 10) {
    mission_name
    launch_date_local
    launch_site {
      site_name_long
    }
  }
    }
  `);

    if (loading) return <p>Loading...</p>;
    if (error) return <p>Error :(</p>;
    console.log(data)
    return data.launchesPast.map(({ mission_name }) => (
        <div key={mission_name}>
            <p>
                {mission_name}
            </p>
        </div>
    ));
}
```
