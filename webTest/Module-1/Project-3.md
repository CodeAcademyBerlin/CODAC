Welcome to Project 3, which focuses on learning one modern JavaScript framework of your choice.

Frameworks are used to make some tasks faster and easier to achieve. However they come with an extra layer of complexity. At their most basic, JS frameworks are collections of JavaScript code libraries that provide developers with pre-written JS code to use for routine programming features to build websites or web applications.

A framework though, differently from a JS library, doesnâ€™t just offer an individual solution to a coding problem, it provides a structure that organizes the parts of your site where the framework is implemented.

The most 3 popular JavaScript frameworks are Vue, React and Angular. They are structured similarly, but their syntax and internal processes are slightly different.

In this module you will have the chance to choose to learn either Vue or React (Angular requires to know TypeScript, therefore it is not a good introduction to the world of JS frameworks).

## Project Overview

During the first Sprint you will have time to get familiar with the framework of your choice by creating a small project.

From the second Sprint, you will have 3 weeks to deliver a Web Progressive Application (WPA) of your choice.

Again the topic will be up to you and we will provide you with the minimum requirements of features.

Towards the end of the project you will learn about Firebase, a powerful Google platform that you will use to create a login feature and to store informations into a database without the need of a Back-End!

**Completion Time**: 4 weeks
