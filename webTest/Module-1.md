In this module, you will learn all the tools to land a job as a Front-End developer. Front-End developers usually take care of the interface of apps and websites and their interactions with the users. In IT terminology, they take care of the client-side.

As a Front-End developer, you might have to deal with many different technologies and projects, work in close collaboration with Web designers and Back-End developers. However, it's very important to understand the full architecture of a website or web application.

### âŒ› Length : 3 Months

### ðŸŽ¯ Learning Objectives

This module will teach you how to use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create beautiful and interactive interfaces. You will learn how to use one of the most popular JavaScript frameworks (React or Vue), communicate with the server-side of any application.
