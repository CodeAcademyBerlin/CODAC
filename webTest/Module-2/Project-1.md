Welcome to the MERN Stack project, which focuses on learning Node.js and MongoDB.

MERN is a powerful stack that will allow you to create Full-Stack architecture using only JavaScript. During this project you will learn how APIs are served to the client-side, how to implement server-side logic and structure your database. In addition you will keep improving your React skills.

## Project Overview

At the end of the project you will have to deliver a Full-Stack Web Progressive Application of your choice. You should see it as a social app, the theme is up to you but each should be able to comment, like and post new content.  
In each Sprint you will have to work on both client and server side at the same time. This is very important because sometimes you will think of a way to build your backend that doesn't work for the frontend you had in mind. Therefore is important to test all your logic as soon as possible.

Folder structure and tidiness are crucial in this project, so please create a new folder for this project and open your text editor at the root of it.

Remember that at this point of the course you have already reached the level of a Junior Front-End developer, therefore spelling mistakes, disogranization of your folders/laptop and unability to search on google for examples or documentation is not accepted anymore.

Here you can find a MERN app developed by a former student: [http://mytinerary-zszokodi.herokuapp.com/](http://mytinerary-zszokodi.herokuapp.com/)

Create a new account and once you are logged in you will be able to do a lot more things than when you are not. Have fun!
