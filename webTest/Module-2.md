In this module you will learn all the tools to land a job as a Full-Stack developer. Full-Stack developers take care of the full architecture of an app or website. In IT terminology, they take care of the client-side and server-side.

This module (1 month long) will teach you how to use Node.js, Express and MongoDB to create server-side logic and serve data through APIs. You will then present them in a beautiful and responsive app with the help of React. This combination of technologies is called MERN Stack (M: MongoDB, E: Express: R: React, N: Node) and it uses JavaScript for both client and server side programming.
